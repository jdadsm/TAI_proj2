" In recent years, technology has had a profound impact on our daily lives and the world around us. From staying connected with loved ones to ordering food online through an app, technology has made our lives easier and more convenient. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and technology can also have negative consequences if used improperly.

One example of this is the spread of misinformation through the internet. It's easy to find articles and sources that may not be accurate or reliable, which can lead to confusion and even harm. Additionally, technology can also pose a threat to our privacy and security if we are not careful about the websites and apps we use.

Despite these potential drawbacks, I believe that technology can be a powerful tool for achieving great things. For example, technology has revolutionized the way we learn and access information. With the internet, we can easily find resources and information on any topic, making it easier to stay informed and up-to-date on current events.

Furthermore, technology has opened up new opportunities for collaboration and communication, allowing people from all over the world to work together and share ideas. This has led to many great achievements and innovations, and I believe that technology will continue to play a vital role in shaping our future.

In conclusion, while technology has its drawbacks, I believe that its potential benefits far outweigh the risks. With responsible use and proper precautions, technology can be a powerful tool for achieving great things and improving our lives.",1
"Should students participate in an extracurricular activity? It may seem like a simple question, but there are actually many different answers to this question. Personally, I think that each student can benefit from joining in on an extracurricular. These may include clubs such as Soccer Club or Harry Potter Club, or maybe something like the school newspaper and Student Council. Each of these can provide a positive impact for every person who joins. I think that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they can help kids make and create new friendships, urge someone to develop a new skill, and encourage students to go outside of their comfort zone.

One way an extracurricular activity can benefit a student is by helping them to create new friendships, or maybe become closer with someone they normally wouldn't. For example, I have a friend who is a member of the Nintendo Club at our school. She is the only girl in the club, yet she has made new and unexpected friends through this experience. There are many different types of people who come together for these activities, so when a person joins in they can meet someone who has the same interests and hobbies. Unexpected friendships can be born through the simple action of attending an extracurricular.

A second positive outcome to participating in an extracurricular is the chance to develop a new skill. Another friend of mine loved to draw and write, but wasn't really a fan of sports. Recently, he decided to attend the Basketball Club and ended up loving it! He has continued to go to Basketball Club, and his skills have increased greatly. Although it may take some time, one can eventually develop a new and fun skill which they normally wouldn't have. Additionally, if someone has multiple skills and talents, that can increase their self esteem. A lot of students have insecurities and worry about not fitting in, however, when they gain a new skill this can boost the way they see themselves and increase their confidence.

The last way a student can benefit from participating in an extracurricular is by encouraging them to step outside of their comfort zone. I think that going outside of your comfort zone is something most people are not comfortable with doing, including myself. Over the summer, my brother switched soccer teams and this was very hard for him. Between having to leave his old team behind and adjusting to the new atmosphere, this new change was very difficult for him. As time went on, and he kept pushing himself outside of his comfort zone, and he had acclimated and adapted to the new environment. Now, my brother is so happy that he decided to go beyond what he was used to and loves his team. Even though this situation wasn't about anÂ extracurricular, they are both related. When a student joins a new club, they may be very nervous. But when someone makes the decision to try something new and take that scary step outside of their comfort zone, there will be many rewards in return. One of which is when people try new things, it can lead them to be successful in the future and inspire others to do the same thing.

To conclude, there are multiple benefits for a person who makes the choice to participate in an extracurricular. These include the chance to make new friends and meet new people, help students to develop a new skill, and urge someone to take a risk and go outside of their comfort zone. Although some may not want to try an extracurricular, it can impact them in so many positive ways. Should students participate in an extracurricular? I think yes, and if someone takes a risk and joins in on one, they might just think yes as well.    ",0
"The electoral college is a symbol of mockery and deprivation of our rights. Voting using this system to elect our leaders is proven null and serves to be removed. Implementing the popular vote in society will not only modernize it but give america its full name for democracy. For many years presidency has debated its ability to be renounced from Electoral college votes or the popular vote. The electoral college is a symbol of our rights as a US citizen being swept under our feet. More formally, this needs to be changed so the people of the U.S can have a greater say in our government, and those who run the country. Granting this power, we will not only modernize but become more democraticPlumerParagraph9.

According to the article "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Not only do citizens agree with changing our system our own appointees do to. Major figures in politics like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole and the U.S Chambe or commerce all agree to the abolishment of electoral college voting privileges. A poll of over 610 voters agree that a direct election should be implemented by the people. This topic can be controversial though. The best argument that reinstates its purpose says "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"". So whats the controversy about we elect them so they elect what we want. The best argument against this is the disaster factor. In the 1960's, segregationists in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors by electing electors who oppose John F. KennedyPlumerParagraph1011 There are numerous factors that contribute towards the banishment of the Electoral College. Ranged from the favoritism of big states with big populations hence the higher amount of electoral votes, to the possibility of a tie in electoral votes. The system is unfair and a symbol of non modern democracy. Direct voting offers a chance to citizens of the US the ability to exercise voting and become part of the government in which we follow. If we always lived in this system, improvements must go on as time progresses so we as a nation can improve to become better. Changing our government is just another major step in our progress to becoming the most sucessful nation.

Changing our system so the voters of the US governize america by direct election is a essential change. According to the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" numerous stories have been told that the Electoral college is an act of anachronismPosnerParagraph15. If the people of the US work hard to remove this we can modernize society forever and make US a better democracy. If we fail to do so, we risk taking a major step backwards in time causing another seggregation act. We have been deprived of many of our rights for too long throughout history and now we have the ability to change. The electoral college has been a shaded act of seggregation and need to dperived of its rights and shut down at a notice.",0
"This is why I think the principle should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time because students should be able to have cell phones in school as long as they don't use it in the middle of learning things. Also as long as the ringer is off so that the student does not disturb anyone.

student should be allowed to have their phones in school because teachers hate when the students are loud when their not supposed to be talking, but with cell phones they would be occupied for a longer period of time. Also because most students who have phones already use them during school anyways so I think it would be much easier for you to just let us use them. Teachers hate having to take phones from the students when they have them out and some students may need with them at all times for personal reason. Maybe even for medical reasons. So that's why I think that we should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.",0
"I strongly believe that meditation and mindfulness practices should be included in schools. These practices have numerous benefits for students, including reducing stress and anxiety, improving focus and concentration, and promoting a sense of calm and well-being.

Firstly, meditation and mindfulness practices have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety in students. In today's fast-paced world, students are often overwhelmed with academic pressures, social media, and other stressors that can affect their mental health. Meditation and mindfulness practices have been proven to help alleviate these stresses, promoting relaxation and calmness. For example, a study conducted by the University of California found that students who participated in a mindfulness program showed a significant reduction in stress and anxiety levels.

Secondly, meditation and mindfulness practices can improve focus and concentration. In today's digital age, students are constantly distracted by their phones, computers, and other electronic devices. Meditation and mindfulness practices help students develop the ability to focus their attention and concentrate on their work. For instance, a study conducted by the University of Washington found that students who meditated regularly showed improved attention and cognitive skills.

Furthermore, meditation and mindfulness practices promote a sense of calm and well-being in students. In addition to reducing stress and improving focus, these practices can also help students develop a greater sense of self-awareness and emotional intelligence. This can lead to better relationships with peers and teachers, as well as improved academic performance. For example, a study conducted by the University of British Columbia found that students who participated in a mindfulness program showed improved emotional regulation and social skills.

In conclusion, the inclusion of meditation and mindfulness practices in schools has numerous benefits for students. These practices have been proven to reduce stress and anxiety, improve focus and concentration, and promote a sense of calm and well-being. As a student in grade 8, I believe that these practices should be incorporated into the school day to help students achieve their full potential and live healthier, happier lives.",1
"As technology develops more, we need to consider what is valueable and what should be left behind. The Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to read students' emotional expressions. Being able to adjust or identify how a student is feeling might prove to be invalueable.

Boredom is a very common feeling in school. It disengages students, stopping them from participating and paying attention all together.

According to the article ÂA classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,Â Dr. Huang predicts. ÂThen it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.Â Technology continues to play a more prominent role in education, this technology could help every student learn and stay interested. Identifying what the student is feeling could make crucial adjustments to the learning plan and the students would be better off for it.

This technology could be valuable for students in a non-academic way. Teachers being able to understand what a student is feeling could be life-saving. People experience problems of different kinds every single day. In paragraph seven the article states, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" A teacher identifying that there is a problem with a student would allow them to talk with that student who might be going through a hard time in there life and provide some relief to a student who might feel burdened or stressed.

This technology would be very valueable in the classroom. Being able to adjust a lesson plan could help students stay engaged and understand the material better. Identifying sadness or any other negative emotion could help with any problems someone might be experiencing at home. The Facial Action Coding System would be benficial to students' mental health and overall well-being.      ",0
"The positive attitude is the key of the success in the life. I agree with this statement. We has to have a good attitude everyday in everywhere. In the work, school, and in the house.

Firts, I agree because the attitude is one of the main charisma in a person. In the work everyone has to have a good character with attitude because is important to be a good workers. In the work is very important to arrive all the time with good attitude and be amiable. The customer can stay happy with the workers work with a good attitude. The customer give tips, and the workers are happy. The workers don't have problems with the chief or the boss.

Second, I think that the attitude is important have in the school because every student have to go to the school everyday with a good attitude. The attitude is one of the main charisma that a student has to have. The students with a good attitude everyone spectable by othres students. The attitude is important to have friendly relations. When they are graduated they remenber that it's important to be good with others and continued in to be good person with a good attitude.

Finally, in the house it's important to keep a good character with good attitude. I think that in the family is more important to have a good attitude. If everyone have a good attitude we live in armony and don't had problems to each others. The attitude in the family is one of the most important that everyone has and live without of problems.

In conclusion, the attitude is one of the main charism that one person can had. many people don't have a good attitude with others , but it's important have good attitude in everywhere to be a good people.",0
"The Electoral College is a process that has been used for presidential elections since the Founding Fathers established it in the constitution. This system does not necessary give the voters a direct vote, but rather a vote for a slate of electors that vote for them. The voters entrust that their elected slate will vote for their favored presidential candidate. It brings up the argument whether this system of voting should be changed or kept. The Electoral College has some of its good points, but over all, it needs to be changed. Voters need a direct say in their vote, and this system turns off the interest of potential voters.

The voters of the United states should have the ability to directly vote for who they want as President. After all, the people are what make up the country and should have say. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,"" says Bradford Plumer in The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.

This means that the Electoral College is unfair to the people because the slate they vote for might not even vote for their candidate. Also, in the same article, Plumer states, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This means that there is a chance that the electors could vote for whoever they please.

This system of voting does not give the voters a direct say as to who they want, but also turns off the interest of voters who should be voting for their country. ""Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know that have no chance of winning..."" as said by Plumer. People within those states would have no motivation to vote for their president because their potienial president did not come to their state to convince them to vote. The candidates are only focused on getting majority of the electoral votes, and not who the people really want. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets ddin't get to see a single campaign ad,"" Plumer had stated. These states lack any information about the potential ruler of their country just because the candidates are focused on the states that will help them win.

Although ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for a party's nominee,"" as said by Richard A. Posner in In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , the possibility of having a winner based on electoral vote and not popular vote is very much possible. For instance, the 2000 election, Gore had won popular vote but due to the electoral vote, Bush had won the election. Gore won the vote for the most popular all over the nation, but because the electoral college had a majority of Bush, it was like the nation's actual vote did not matter.

The Electoral College is unfair to the people because they do not get a direct say for who they want, and the candidates only focus on states that will help them win based on electoral vote. The people need a say exactly who they want and should not depend on others to do the vote for them. Canidates should not only appeal to states that would make them win, but also to other states so the whole nation knows exactly who might be ruling over their country.",0
"Having school every single day is nobodies favorite free time to others it's there favorite hobby it also takes time and alot of studying to. There making everything so easy for us this year they will do 3 years of high school if I studying really hard to not stay for all 4 years by that addition they will be including to have courses during on summers or in evenings or may not be able to take elective courses. Which will be really helpful for me to have more hours to myself more of my free time I could studying way more to. More than I knew about these prgrams im glad I found about it because it can be a big change for me and everybody else. It's a 50 50 deal to me because your going to miss on 1 year ,but also you can do so much go apply to colleges and have a job because you would have more time for all the better thats coming to you.

On the outcome you would be helping yourself out spend your summer on school time or you can have less hours of going to school on evenings sleep in more in the miday. All 4 years you can be doing the total of 3 years you would just be doing fulltime but it's also the choice you make on evenings or in the summer days. Luckily you can do anthing what you want and could imagine if you can put your mind to it and it will appear better days. Although everything in life you will get because its how you want your future to be but if it's for you it will not go away. At any age you can graduate young or as a older person but when you do you will be a successful leader.

My main priority in life is school since I was a child I always love coming in to school it was always my focus in life to overcome the end of it. School has always been my favorite because you saw your friends and it's how you start your day also good connection than having a studying buddy to make everything work. A high school deploma is your way to the next door it's access to everything you will ever need later on to your future. After your done high school you will be feeling as a pot of gold apply in purssure and you will get there apply to many awesome colleges and now that you have time you can have a job. The program is an outstanding choice and make the choice now your missing on a life time opportunity.",0
"One way school administrators can attempt to create an environment conducive to learning is by regulating the use of phones during school lunch. On the one hand, having a policy that allows the use of phones during school lunch can create a more relaxed atmosphere and provide students with an opportunity to unwind and connect with friends and family outside of the classroom. Furthermore, allowing phones during lunch can make it easier for students to access educational resources, such as online dictionaries and fact-checking websites. On the other hand, having a policy that does not allow phones during school lunch can help create an environment that is less distracting for both students and staff. This can allow students to focus on their lunch and conversations with their peers, while providing a break from constant phone use. Additionally, not allowing phones during lunch can also reduce the risk of data misuse, as students become less exposed to social media and online services. Ultimately, each school will need to decide which policy is appropriate for its setting, in order to create a safe and supportive school environment.",1
"Dear Principal,

I think policy 1 is the better policy 2 because if you allow students bring phones to school lunch will be less noisy and students will always have something to do during free time and less students will get in trouble for sneaking texts or calls since they will have a time to do it.

If you allow cell phones lunch will be less noisy because everybody will be busy texting instead of talking loudly and goofing off. Lunch would be a lot better off if we had cell phones because there wouldn't be a lot of auguring because everybody's texting instead of getting in to dumb arguments.

If you allow cell phones at school students will always have something to do at free time. teachers will never have to send students to there lockers to get something to do they can just pull out there phone and surf the web or text. There will no longer be a student sitting at there desk doing nothing.

Also If you allow cell phones at school there will be less lunch detentions given out for student getting caught texting during appropriate times. There will be very few detentions for students because most detentions are because students text during lunch or home room.

So if you would dear principal please consider policy number 1 over 2.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",0
"While summer is meant as a break from the regular school routine, having some structured learning over the summer can help students maintain important skills and knowledge. When given the choice, I believe summer projects are best when student-designed rather than teacher-designed.

When students have autonomy in choosing their own summer project topics, they are more motivated to engage in meaningful learning. By allowing students to pick subjects they find genuinely interesting or relevant to their lives, they will be internally driven to explore the topic in depth. This type of intrinsic motivation leads to better focus and quality of work compared to assignments chosen by teachers without student input. 

Giving students ownership over project topics also fosters independence and skill development. By guiding their own work, students learn valuable skills like time management, decision making, and self-directed learning - skills that will serve them well in higher education and careers. Trying to complete a task completely of their own design also builds confidence facing open-ended challenges.

Of course, some guidance is still useful to ensure projects have educational merit. Teachers could provide general parameters like the type of final work (essay, presentation, etc.) or subject area but leave the specific focus up to students. This balance of student choice within guidelines maximizes engagement while maintaining academic standards.

In conclusion, when the goal is to sustain learning over summer break, student-designed projects are ideal. By letting students follow their interests with some guidance, they are intrinsically driven to dive deeply into self-directed work - an approach that serves their development far better than topics assigned externally. Autonomy, motivation and skill-building will better prepare students for future challenges compared to rigid, teacher-driven assignments over break.",1
"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could have both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, this technology may help teachers understand how their lessons are engaging students on an emotional level. If a teacher notices many students appear bored or confused during a lesson, FACS could provide valuable feedback to improve instruction methods. It could also assist teachers in identifying students who are struggling emotionally but may not express it otherwise. This type of technology could help teachers provide better emotional support to students. 

However, constant monitoring of students' facial expressions with FACS also raises privacy and behavioral issues. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing their emotional reactions are being surveilled and analyzed in real time. This could increase anxiety and discourage natural emotional responses during class. Students should feel free to focus internally on learning without worrying about expressions being screened. Additionally, identifying emotions through facial expressions alone may not provide full context and could result in misinterpretations. A student's expression may not accurately reflect how they internally feel about a lesson.

Overall, while FACS technology aims to give teachers useful insights, its continuous use in the classroom to monitor students risks invading privacy and altering natural classroom behaviors. Teachers could benefit from occasional voluntary emotional check-ins with students, but constant facial monitoring goes too far. More traditional methods of teacher-student communication are generally preferable to validate a student's emotional experience in school. If used sparingly and with consent, this technology may offer value, but broader application could do more harm than good.",1
"The auther suggests that studying is a worthly pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Like Venus is even more challanging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmopsheric.

The venusian geology and the weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightningstrikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

And the most entresting thing is that somtimes Mars and Venus are closer to earth. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has a value, not only because of the insight on the planet in how it had lots of bad things, but we still would have the good things that would we need to make people to survive in venus. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.          ",0
"I strongly believe art classes such as drama, acting, and music should not be a requirement for students. I also strongly believe that students should have freedom to choose which elective him or her want's to take. A student that has the freedom to choose his or hers electives, he or she views the classes as more divers fun and interactive, then required art classes.

First of all most people believes that all students are required to take art class, music, and drama class. Most of all others think that students will actually cooperate to there fullest, and pass the class with higher letter grads. Like in an unrequited class most students will not actually take the art classes seriously, and fail with low letter grades. In comparison students with a required class will most likely take the class seriously knowing if they dont tighten up, and do what is asked the'll get low grades on multiple assignments like projects, class projects, and event tests. An nonparticipating students score will drop significantly. Which in fact they are wrong student shouldnt have to take the art classes to begin with.

In my true opinion student should have the chance to express his or her true feelings, and reach a main goal in life. People arent going to tell use students what career paths to fallow we simply choose our own paths. Really in fact art classes should be an elective instead of it having to be required. Art classes are fun I my self take art by choose and enjoy ever single part of it. Again arts should not be a requirement for students it is unethical, and unheard of as far as i know.

Music, drama, and art class are three amazing electives, and forever will be electives. what sense is it to make an art class a requirement to pass? No sense in my opinion art allows us students to express out inner happiness, deepest emotions, and embrace them. However, at the end of the day art classes should be and always stay an elective. What use will it be to us students in the real world? No use at all, unless a student wants to fallow a career path in art.

All the more reasons why I know art classes such as drama, acting, and music classes should not be a requirement for students. Electives are much more divers, fun, and interactive. Also students should have the freedom to choose his or her electives. There is no sense in making an art class a requiermnet for use students. Most students are not fallowing a type of caree in art, and will not be of much use to us in the future.",0

One example why i chose this profession is because when i was a child i see my parents they want to help me when i have homework but they dont know a lot of thing because they not have the opportunities to go a school if i can be a teacher i want to teach that kind of people i hope you can give me this opportunities.",0
"Seeking multiple options could show someone a variety of things they could do. Instead of only seeing something one way, someone could be able to use many peoples opinions to form their own. People around us look at the choices we make and form opinions about us through those decisions. If we go around doing the first thing that comes to mind, people will see that, and think of us as irresponsible people.

The option that is available to someone at first may not always be the best, and it is good to take a step back to survey what multiple people say before you pursue a decision. A good analogy for this idea is someone surveying an island that they have just come across. They would need to get to a vantage point, then make a decision after seeing what they are dealing with on this new land that is unfamiliar to them. Any person who doesn't take a second to survey what they have to do is going to make a bad decision sooner or later in their life, so it is good to do so if a person wants to be successful.

Somebody giving you advice on something may not actually like you, and they might be trying to manipulate you. Fake friends could tell you to go somewhere with them because it will be fun, even if they know it's dangerous or not in your best interest. If you seek more advice from other individuals that may be looking out for your best interest then you will be able to make decisions easier. Seeking multiple people's opinions may help give you a better reputation, while keeping you safer because the decisions you make will most likely be influenced by at least one person looking out for you.

Not only is seeking advice from multiple people a good practice, but getting multiple peoples opinions on something or someone is also very helpful so that you do not judge someone or something off of one person's opinion on them. Someones opinion on something may come from a past experience with the subject, and that opinion may help you in understanding what kind of person somebody is. Or somebody could be feeding you lies about someone or something because of some sort of bias because of race, religion or anything like that.

In conclusion if you seek understanding by getting multiple peoples advice then youÂ will be more likely to form a better decision and have better opinions about things all around you. Some people's advice is meant to hurt you and some peoples advice is biased. Getting multiple perspectives is always good because it helps you grasp the bigger picture.Â ",0
