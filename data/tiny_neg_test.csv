"Research shows that students work better at home compared to going to school five days out of the week. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home rather than at school because It relives them from large amounts of stress, its allows them to to focus and learn more efficiently, and it gives them plenty of one on one time with their teacher.To start off, attending classes at home will relive students of stress. Many students go to school with bullies and many unkind people, the aftermath of this it that many students suffer from stress and anxiety. Stress and anxiety are not good for human beings physically, mentally, and emotionally. Therefore we should take it very seriously especially for the students trying there hardest to receive a good education. For instance there are multiple bullies in school that enjoy picking with others, this causes students to be fearful of going to class. Being bullied is a big burden to bare. This will cause many students to not willingly attend school in fear of being bullied. Also school can be very hard and challenging. While your at home their is a higher possibility of being more relaxed and calm, rather than at school it can be very hectic and judging. Home is somewhere and you can relax in a quiet peaceful area while you are doing your schoolwork. Taking classes at home will allow students to stay away from all the hate and negativity.Furthermore, attending classes at home will allow students to be able to focus and concentrate more efficiently. Many students complain of their classmates being goofy or disruptive, students in the hall making noises and being to loud, and even fights and arguments within the class rooms are a major interruption. If students had classes at home it would be so much easier for them to focus in a calm and quiet area. For an example, Many teachers say that multiple people in there classes find it hard to focus due to class clowns, students acting out, hallway disruptions, and being distracted by doing things that were not instructed by the teachers. Also many students found it very challenging to focus on what they needed to when all they heard was ruckus. A result of not being able to pay attention, many students tend to fail or not make the grades needed to pass the class or even the grade. Many parents would consider having their children attend their classes at home so there children can be successful. In order of passing your will have to be able to pay attention which is very hard in a class full of students.Lastly, it allows students to have more one on one time with there teachers. In a class full of students, it can be very hard trying to assist every students with all there wants and needs. Also there are many students that are confused on what they are learning because the lack of help and attention they are receiving. For example, a students once said at one point she was clueless on what she was doing. This was because the teacher was never able to get with her and work through the problems due to the teacher trying to satisfy everyone else needs. This is a problem because every now and then students need individual help and it is hard to receive that help when others need it as well. This can all be resolved by letting students attend classes at home. This will allow students to receive the one on one help they need with their teacher. The teacher will be able to walk through with the student step by step and teach them the way needed.In conclusion, Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home rather than at school because It relives them from large amounts of stress, its allows them to to focus and learn more efficiently, and it gives them plenty of one on one time with their teacher. Attending classes at home will benifit studnets in many ways.                   "
"Mona Lisa's 83 percent happy, 9 parcent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinchi studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convery specific emotions. His new computer software stores smilar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of ""Da Vinci Code""! The Mona lisa demonstation is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. The muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around my eyes. The muscles will not make lie, so Mona Lisa have wonder parts of human. Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.These are essay, so we can know the Dr., Hung and The Vinci are so good person and very smart because my summary shows that.I thought the Mona Lisa had not alive at their time, so she is just picuture.I will find some good art. It will be better than Mona Lisa. We colud get informatin if we have science knowlende. I understood the art world of little."
"It is alarming to think that less than twenty years ago virtual technology was just being invented, and ever since the turn of the 21st century the world has started to use technology and virtual data more and more. The world has started to trend in a direction in which humans rely on technology. For example, tools like phones and cars are used everyday. Virtual technology can be helpful however, and it is currently expanding to provide humans with new ways to make life easier. One way technology is being introduced to benefit humans is through distance learning or online classes. This new form of learning allows students to attend school from the comfort of their own homes. Distance learning gives students a more customized and adaptive learning experience while giving students more time to engage in the extracurriculars they love.One way distance learning is beneficial for students is because it allows students to customize their classes. For example, Students in the public education system can only enroll in courses that are offered at their school. This may restrict students from taking classes that they are interested in or limit students from branching out and potentially finding a new passion. However, students taking online classes can choose from a wide variety of classes, that most likely incorporate their interests. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning is beneficial for students. Not only do student have the freedom to choose what to learn, they also have the freedom to choose when to learn. Having the freedom of choosing when to learn is vital for students with specific needs or disabilities. When students are unable to go to school, learning can continue. This eliminates sick days, weather delays or cancellations, and school holidays. Furthermore, students are able to take courses at their own speed. Rather than the typical every other day school schedule, students can master a course in less than a month. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning and when a student can learn is beneficial for all students.Another benefit to learning from home is that it gives students more time to focus on their needs and wants rather than the schools. In certain cases when student prodigies are more focused on a sport, a musical instrument or a job, learning from home can grant students more time to perfect their craft. Online learning allows them to have their primary focus being on what they love rather than on a rigorous and time wasting traditional school day. Another example is in the case of a student that does not thrive in a the social aspect of school. Sometimes kids feel overwhelmed and threatened by the large amount of students in one school. In order to feel comfortable, kids could video conference into school and learn from the comfort of their own home. School can be long and sometimes overwhelming so in certain cases distance learning can be beneficial.Learning is essential to grow as an individual but also as a population and with new technology, accomadating for certain needs is easy and beneficial. Distance learning is a way for students to customize when and what they want to learn as well as feel comfortable and adapt to their needs. Distance learning is a thing of the future that will soon benefit many. "
"Driverless cars should be allowed when they are safe, and when they are complete. You still should let people drive regular cars though because doing this is taking away people's freedom to drive if the cars become fully driverless. Just think about all the teenagers who won't get to expeirience driver's ed and getting their license and how exciting it is.Also if there is a technical problem with the driverless cars it could be a hazzard. If they are going to make them driverless they should at least make where the person can manually control it incase of failing technology. The car also since it isn't a human it doesn't have the reaction time that our brains allow us to have. It also doesn't have judgement and any skills to fix itself if the car breaks down.It would also make people mad because they have a right to drive and some won't like it if you take that away from them. Also some people are control freaks and always would like to be in control of their vehicle. You also couldn't own your own car as the story says because it will be more of an automative cab system instead of your own propery. So no more making your vehicle the way you wan't it, it would also take away people's hobbies of fixing up cars.The other thing is that it would cost people and the government more to keep the cars up and running with all the technology and also how many cars there will be to satisfy people. Also what would we do with all the old cars? Would we just junk all of the old cars? The smart cars would also have to be able to adapt to ever road condition as well if they are driverless and it would be hard to program all different cars for different conditions. It would also cost a lot to fund this in the first place and to get people to warm up to the idea.I think that if we do the driverless cars then it should also be affordable for people to use. I also don't think that technology could mimic a human's actions when they drive because a human body is way more advanced than technology is. If something happend to the car while you were in it what would you do? would you have to call someone, because the normal person couldn't fix the tech inside of a driverless car to get it back up and running. People in the story even said that we would need smart roads as well to make this work. They also said what would happen in an accident and if it would be the fault of the person in the car or the car manufacturer. Also they would need to make countless new laws to even make this car legal and able to drive on the roads because as of now the cars are only legal in three states and the capital.So that is why I am against the use of driverless cars for now mostly because I don't think they would be safe to use."
