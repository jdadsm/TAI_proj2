"Should students participate in an extracurricular activity? It may seem like a simple question, but there are actually many different answers to this question. Personally, I think that each student can benefit from joining in on an extracurricular. These may include clubs such as Soccer Club or Harry Potter Club, or maybe something like the school newspaper and Student Council. Each of these can provide a positive impact for every person who joins. I think that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they can help kids make and create new friendships, urge someone to develop a new skill, and encourage students to go outside of their comfort zone.One way an extracurricular activity can benefit a student is by helping them to create new friendships, or maybe become closer with someone they normally wouldn't. For example, I have a friend who is a member of the Nintendo Club at our school. She is the only girl in the club, yet she has made new and unexpected friends through this experience. There are many different types of people who come together for these activities, so when a person joins in they can meet someone who has the same interests and hobbies. Unexpected friendships can be born through the simple action of attending an extracurricular.A second positive outcome to participating in an extracurricular is the chance to develop a new skill. Another friend of mine loved to draw and write, but wasn't really a fan of sports. Recently, he decided to attend the Basketball Club and ended up loving it! He has continued to go to Basketball Club, and his skills have increased greatly. Although it may take some time, one can eventually develop a new and fun skill which they normally wouldn't have. Additionally, if someone has multiple skills and talents, that can increase their self esteem. A lot of students have insecurities and worry about not fitting in, however, when they gain a new skill this can boost the way they see themselves and increase their confidence.The last way a student can benefit from participating in an extracurricular is by encouraging them to step outside of their comfort zone. I think that going outside of your comfort zone is something most people are not comfortable with doing, including myself. Over the summer, my brother switched soccer teams and this was very hard for him. Between having to leave his old team behind and adjusting to the new atmosphere, this new change was very difficult for him. As time went on, and he kept pushing himself outside of his comfort zone, and he had acclimated and adapted to the new environment. Now, my brother is so happy that he decided to go beyond what he was used to and loves his team. Even though this situation wasn't about an extracurricular, they are both related. When a student joins a new club, they may be very nervous. But when someone makes the decision to try something new and take that scary step outside of their comfort zone, there will be many rewards in return. One of which is when people try new things, it can lead them to be successful in the future and inspire others to do the same thing.To conclude, there are multiple benefits for a person who makes the choice to participate in an extracurricular. These include the chance to make new friends and meet new people, help students to develop a new skill, and urge someone to take a risk and go outside of their comfort zone. Although some may not want to try an extracurricular, it can impact them in so many positive ways. Should students participate in an extracurricular? I think yes, and if someone takes a risk and joins in on one, they might just think yes as well.    "
"The electoral college is a symbol of mockery and deprivation of our rights. Voting using this system to elect our leaders is proven null and serves to be removed. Implementing the popular vote in society will not only modernize it but give america its full name for democracy. For many years presidency has debated its ability to be renounced from Electoral college votes or the popular vote. The electoral college is a symbol of our rights as a US citizen being swept under our feet. More formally, this needs to be changed so the people of the U.S can have a greater say in our government, and those who run the country. Granting this power, we will not only modernize but become more democraticPlumerParagraph9.According to the article "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Not only do citizens agree with changing our system our own appointees do to. Major figures in politics like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole and the U.S Chambe or commerce all agree to the abolishment of electoral college voting privileges. A poll of over 610 voters agree that a direct election should be implemented by the people. This topic can be controversial though. The best argument that reinstates its purpose says "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"". So whats the controversy about we elect them so they elect what we want. The best argument against this is the disaster factor. In the 1960's, segregationists in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors by electing electors who oppose John F. KennedyPlumerParagraph1011 There are numerous factors that contribute towards the banishment of the Electoral College. Ranged from the favoritism of big states with big populations hence the higher amount of electoral votes, to the possibility of a tie in electoral votes. The system is unfair and a symbol of non modern democracy. Direct voting offers a chance to citizens of the US the ability to exercise voting and become part of the government in which we follow. If we always lived in this system, improvements must go on as time progresses so we as a nation can improve to become better. Changing our government is just another major step in our progress to becoming the most sucessful nation.Changing our system so the voters of the US governize america by direct election is a essential change. According to the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" numerous stories have been told that the Electoral college is an act of anachronismPosnerParagraph15. If the people of the US work hard to remove this we can modernize society forever and make US a better democracy. If we fail to do so, we risk taking a major step backwards in time causing another seggregation act. We have been deprived of many of our rights for too long throughout history and now we have the ability to change. The electoral college has been a shaded act of seggregation and need to dperived of its rights and shut down at a notice."
"This is why I think the principle should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time because students should be able to have cell phones in school as long as they don't use it in the middle of learning things. Also as long as the ringer is off so that the student does not disturb anyone.student should be allowed to have their phones in school because teachers hate when the students are loud when their not supposed to be talking, but with cell phones they would be occupied for a longer period of time. Also because most students who have phones already use them during school anyways so I think it would be much easier for you to just let us use them. Teachers hate having to take phones from the students when they have them out and some students may need with them at all times for personal reason. Maybe even for medical reasons. So that's why I think that we should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time."
"As technology develops more, we need to consider what is valueable and what should be left behind. The Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to read students' emotional expressions. Being able to adjust or identify how a student is feeling might prove to be invalueable.Boredom is a very common feeling in school. It disengages students, stopping them from participating and paying attention all together.According to the article A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Technology continues to play a more prominent role in education, this technology could help every student learn and stay interested. Identifying what the student is feeling could make crucial adjustments to the learning plan and the students would be better off for it.This technology could be valuable for students in a non-academic way. Teachers being able to understand what a student is feeling could be life-saving. People experience problems of different kinds every single day. In paragraph seven the article states, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" A teacher identifying that there is a problem with a student would allow them to talk with that student who might be going through a hard time in there life and provide some relief to a student who might feel burdened or stressed.This technology would be very valueable in the classroom. Being able to adjust a lesson plan could help students stay engaged and understand the material better. Identifying sadness or any other negative emotion could help with any problems someone might be experiencing at home. The Facial Action Coding System would be benficial to students' mental health and overall well-being.      "
"The positive attitude is the key of the success in the life. I agree with this statement. We has to have a good attitude everyday in everywhere. In the work, school, and in the house.Firts, I agree because the attitude is one of the main charisma in a person. In the work everyone has to have a good character with attitude because is important to be a good workers. In the work is very important to arrive all the time with good attitude and be amiable. The customer can stay happy with the workers work with a good attitude. The customer give tips, and the workers are happy. The workers don't have problems with the chief or the boss.Second, I think that the attitude is important have in the school because every student have to go to the school everyday with a good attitude. The attitude is one of the main charisma that a student has to have. The students with a good attitude everyone spectable by othres students. The attitude is important to have friendly relations. When they are graduated they remenber that it's important to be good with others and continued in to be good person with a good attitude.Finally, in the house it's important to keep a good character with good attitude. I think that in the family is more important to have a good attitude. If everyone have a good attitude we live in armony and don't had problems to each others. The attitude in the family is one of the most important that everyone has and live without of problems.In conclusion, the attitude is one of the main charism that one person can had. many people don't have a good attitude with others , but it's important have good attitude in everywhere to be a good people."
"The Electoral College is a process that has been used for presidential elections since the Founding Fathers established it in the constitution. This system does not necessary give the voters a direct vote, but rather a vote for a slate of electors that vote for them. The voters entrust that their elected slate will vote for their favored presidential candidate. It brings up the argument whether this system of voting should be changed or kept. The Electoral College has some of its good points, but over all, it needs to be changed. Voters need a direct say in their vote, and this system turns off the interest of potential voters.The voters of the United states should have the ability to directly vote for who they want as President. After all, the people are what make up the country and should have say. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,"" says Bradford Plumer in The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.This means that the Electoral College is unfair to the people because the slate they vote for might not even vote for their candidate. Also, in the same article, Plumer states, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This means that there is a chance that the electors could vote for whoever they please.This system of voting does not give the voters a direct say as to who they want, but also turns off the interest of voters who should be voting for their country. ""Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know that have no chance of winning..."" as said by Plumer. People within those states would have no motivation to vote for their president because their potienial president did not come to their state to convince them to vote. The candidates are only focused on getting majority of the electoral votes, and not who the people really want. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets ddin't get to see a single campaign ad,"" Plumer had stated. These states lack any information about the potential ruler of their country just because the candidates are focused on the states that will help them win.Although ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for a party's nominee,"" as said by Richard A. Posner in In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , the possibility of having a winner based on electoral vote and not popular vote is very much possible. For instance, the 2000 election, Gore had won popular vote but due to the electoral vote, Bush had won the election. Gore won the vote for the most popular all over the nation, but because the electoral college had a majority of Bush, it was like the nation's actual vote did not matter.The Electoral College is unfair to the people because they do not get a direct say for who they want, and the candidates only focus on states that will help them win based on electoral vote. The people need a say exactly who they want and should not depend on others to do the vote for them. Canidates should not only appeal to states that would make them win, but also to other states so the whole nation knows exactly who might be ruling over their country."
"Having school every single day is nobodies favorite free time to others it's there favorite hobby it also takes time and alot of studying to. There making everything so easy for us this year they will do 3 years of high school if I studying really hard to not stay for all 4 years by that addition they will be including to have courses during on summers or in evenings or may not be able to take elective courses. Which will be really helpful for me to have more hours to myself more of my free time I could studying way more to. More than I knew about these prgrams im glad I found about it because it can be a big change for me and everybody else. It's a 50 50 deal to me because your going to miss on 1 year ,but also you can do so much go apply to colleges and have a job because you would have more time for all the better thats coming to you.On the outcome you would be helping yourself out spend your summer on school time or you can have less hours of going to school on evenings sleep in more in the miday. All 4 years you can be doing the total of 3 years you would just be doing fulltime but it's also the choice you make on evenings or in the summer days. Luckily you can do anthing what you want and could imagine if you can put your mind to it and it will appear better days. Although everything in life you will get because its how you want your future to be but if it's for you it will not go away. At any age you can graduate young or as a older person but when you do you will be a successful leader.My main priority in life is school since I was a child I always love coming in to school it was always my focus in life to overcome the end of it. School has always been my favorite because you saw your friends and it's how you start your day also good connection than having a studying buddy to make everything work. A high school deploma is your way to the next door it's access to everything you will ever need later on to your future. After your done high school you will be feeling as a pot of gold apply in purssure and you will get there apply to many awesome colleges and now that you have time you can have a job. The program is an outstanding choice and make the choice now your missing on a life time opportunity."
"Dear Principal,I think policy 1 is the better policy 2 because if you allow students bring phones to school lunch will be less noisy and students will always have something to do during free time and less students will get in trouble for sneaking texts or calls since they will have a time to do it.If you allow cell phones lunch will be less noisy because everybody will be busy texting instead of talking loudly and goofing off. Lunch would be a lot better off if we had cell phones because there wouldn't be a lot of auguring because everybody's texting instead of getting in to dumb arguments.If you allow cell phones at school students will always have something to do at free time. teachers will never have to send students to there lockers to get something to do they can just pull out there phone and surf the web or text. There will no longer be a student sitting at there desk doing nothing.Also If you allow cell phones at school there will be less lunch detentions given out for student getting caught texting during appropriate times. There will be very few detentions for students because most detentions are because students text during lunch or home room.So if you would dear principal please consider policy number 1 over 2.Sincerely,STUDENT_NAME"
"The auther suggests that studying is a worthly pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Like Venus is even more challanging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmopsheric. Its more extreme than anything that a human encounter on earth. Venus has the hottest suface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Venus would be the place where there would be lots of problems like not easy conditions.when using phones, tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. I feel like we would need more advanced things from earth in Venus because Venus would have the hottest suface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to the sun. ""It would the most challenging in exploring venus"". The venusian geology and the weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightningstrikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.And the most entresting thing is that somtimes Mars and Venus are closer to earth. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has a value, not only because of the insight on the planet in how it had lots of bad things, but we still would have the good things that would we need to make people to survive in venus. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.          "
"I strongly believe art classes such as drama, acting, and music should not be a requirement for students. I also strongly believe that students should have freedom to choose which elective him or her want's to take. A student that has the freedom to choose his or hers electives, he or she views the classes as more divers fun and interactive, then required art classes.First of all most people believes that all students are required to take art class, music, and drama class. Most of all others think that students will actually cooperate to there fullest, and pass the class with higher letter grads. Like in an unrequited class most students will not actually take the art classes seriously, and fail with low letter grades. In comparison students with a required class will most likely take the class seriously knowing if they dont tighten up, and do what is asked the'll get low grades on multiple assignments like projects, class projects, and event tests. An nonparticipating students score will drop significantly. Which in fact they are wrong student shouldnt have to take the art classes to begin with.In my true opinion student should have the chance to express his or her true feelings, and reach a main goal in life. People arent going to tell use students what career paths to fallow we simply choose our own paths. Really in fact art classes should be an elective instead of it having to be required. Art classes are fun I my self take art by choose and enjoy ever single part of it. Again arts should not be a requirement for students it is unethical, and unheard of as far as i know.Music, drama, and art class are three amazing electives, and forever will be electives. what sense is it to make an art class a requirement to pass? No sense in my opinion art allows us students to express out inner happiness, deepest emotions, and embrace them. However, at the end of the day art classes should be and always stay an elective. What use will it be to us students in the real world? No use at all, unless a student wants to fallow a career path in art.All the more reasons why I know art classes such as drama, acting, and music classes should not be a requirement for students. Electives are much more divers, fun, and interactive. Also students should have the freedom to choose his or her electives. There is no sense in making an art class a requiermnet for use students. Most students are not fallowing a type of caree in art, and will not be of much use to us in the future."
"Mr. manager i want to explore certain occupation through internships and shadowing i read that you are given the opportunities to student to explore a certain occupation;I want to learn about how became a teacher i like this profession and i think this is my opportunities to discover all of the things about this profession.One of the reason is because i want to help children in a school and teach all of the things that they need to know for their future .I can teach to parents that parents want finish a career and they want to finish and have a diploma so they can have a better job for that reasons is what i want to be a teacher so i can help people with education this is why i hope you can give me this opportunities, because i want to learn all the thing that i needed to this profession.One example why i chose this profession is because when i was a child i see my parents they want to help me when i have homework but they dont know a lot of thing because they not have the opportunities to go a school if i can be a teacher i want to teach that kind of people i hope you can give me this opportunities."
"Seeking multiple options could show someone a variety of things they could do. Instead of only seeing something one way, someone could be able to use many peoples opinions to form their own. People around us look at the choices we make and form opinions about us through those decisions. If we go around doing the first thing that comes to mind, people will see that, and think of us as irresponsible people.The option that is available to someone at first may not always be the best, and it is good to take a step back to survey what multiple people say before you pursue a decision. A good analogy for this idea is someone surveying an island that they have just come across. They would need to get to a vantage point, then make a decision after seeing what they are dealing with on this new land that is unfamiliar to them. Any person who doesn't take a second to survey what they have to do is going to make a bad decision sooner or later in their life, so it is good to do so if a person wants to be successful.Somebody giving you advice on something may not actually like you, and they might be trying to manipulate you. Fake friends could tell you to go somewhere with them because it will be fun, even if they know it's dangerous or not in your best interest. If you seek more advice from other individuals that may be looking out for your best interest then you will be able to make decisions easier. Seeking multiple people's opinions may help give you a better reputation, while keeping you safer because the decisions you make will most likely be influenced by at least one person looking out for you.Not only is seeking advice from multiple people a good practice, but getting multiple peoples opinions on something or someone is also very helpful so that you do not judge someone or something off of one person's opinion on them. Someones opinion on something may come from a past experience with the subject, and that opinion may help you in understanding what kind of person somebody is. Or somebody could be feeding you lies about someone or something because of some sort of bias because of race, religion or anything like that.In conclusion if you seek understanding by getting multiple peoples advice then you will be more likely to form a better decision and have better opinions about things all around you. Some people's advice is meant to hurt you and some peoples advice is biased. Getting multiple perspectives is always good because it helps you grasp the bigger picture. "
"I think that limiting car usage is great for the environment. There are a lot of benifits that come from it. If we use car less then greenhouse gas emissons will decrease and thus cleaning the air of smog. Some of the benefits that limiting car use is that: 1. it decreases poisonous smog, 2. lots of cities in the world are doing it, 3. and last but not least it could promote other ways of travel. Its about time that the world start changing some harmful habits.To start of, Reducing car use is very effective when trying to get rid of smog. In some cities such as Paris, smog is a big pollution there. In Paris they even went head to head with Beijing,China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of this globally known city. by enforcing this, some days cars with even numbered license plate could drive. The next day odd numbered cars could drive. If you were caught then you were fined. so by paris doing this congestion was down a whopping 60% in Paris after just 5 days.This would cut down greenhouse effects tremendously. So far reducing car use sounds pretty good.Furthermore Paris isnt the only place in the world to do this. Bogota,Colombia in a program that's set to spread to other countries, miliions of Colombians either hiked, bike, skated, or took a bus to commute around the countriy to their destination. This is known as a car free day. This car-free day left the streets of the capitol void and empty of rush hour traffic. Even the U.S. goverment is considering the international event that is also helping the environment at the same time.Another thing to reduce greenhouse gas is if people would find a more alternative way of transportation. City buses could count as an alternative,because think if a bus could seat 30 people. Think if all 30 people had their own car, then the emisson amout would substantialy increase 30 vehicles rather than 1 vehicle . Other ways of transpotation are things such as bikes, skates/skateboard, or just walking. none of those alternatives release any type of emissions.In a way not using cars sounds great in many ways,but there are those people out there that rely on the usage of cars to transport themselves such as anyone with physical handicaps. Maybe this is the start of something new but what happens to this earth is all on us so it what we dicide to do with it rather we wont it to last or we can just let it go and lose the one planet we have left.                                 "
"I feel as if the technology is very adavnced to notice every kids face in a room. I believe it would work! If the technology can work on a masterpiece from centuries ago, why wouldn't it work on a couple of students?In the text it says "" By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions"". A classroom full of kids is at the huighest, 31. I do believe that the technology can do just that. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" A classroom has more than six people in it. So the technology is more than advanced.To conclude, the FACS can notice every muscle in your face. The technology is so strong! ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" It can focus on all 25 to 30 children faces at once. The technology will work on the kids in the classroom."
"There is way to forget all of the school work and do something a lot more funnier during the day its called doing an extracurricular. For example, you had a very boring day in all of your class's ,and having that extracurricular like a sport could set you in a different mood. I strongly agree having an extracurricular is a good idea for the students. It's a good use of free time away from the school work, future careers ,and it would be fun for the students.An extracurricular is a great way to get away from school stress. There are some days students have to do nothing but sit down and write for the whole day. Research says that doing this same cycle everyday will not help students intake information the right way. Having this extracurricular is also a lot like having your brain rest to better process that information.A extracurricular would be great for students looking for more experience for future careers. like joining the student council or doing a sport. For example joining the students council is like taking ownership of a job ,and doing a sport like football, soccer and wrestling start to get young athletes to get a lot better. An extracurricular can be very helpful in the long run.Having a extracurricular would be a lot of fun for students picking what they wanna do. Like some students that have a heart for sports or if other students want more of a challenge joining the student council may be fun for them. Research says that when your're a lot more happy you are more awake and ready to learn. If all the students did an extra curricular it would for a fact brighten their moods.In conclusion, having a extracurricular is a good idea for the students. It's fun and it would get more students to wanna do it. Its a good use for free time and to take a break from school work. Helps out a lot of students for the real world. "
